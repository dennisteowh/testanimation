# testanimation
This is a simple browser application that allows you to test simple animation strips.  

How To Use:

1. Upload your animation strip as an image file into the folder.

2. Open the "main.js" file using any text editor.

3. At the top of the script, you should see a section that lets you specify your image details.

  1. height refers to the height of your image in pixels.

  2. width refers to the width of your image in pixels.

  3. frame refers to the number of frames in your animation strip.

  4. filename refers to filename of your image.

  5. cyclerate controls the speed of your animation. Roughly, a cyclerate of 10 means that one cycle of your animation will be completed in 10 standard framerates. Increasing this number leads to slower animations and vice versa.

4. After modifying these specifications, you can save the "main.js" file and open the "index.html" file in your local browser.

5. The "move" button starts the animation while the "stop" button freezes the animation.
